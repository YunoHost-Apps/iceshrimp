## Overview

Iceshrimp is a decentralized and federated social networking service, implementing the ActivityPub standard.

It was forked from Calckey Firefish (itself a fork of Misskey) in mid-2023, to focus on stability, performance and usability instead of new features.

**Shipped version:** 2023.12.5~ynh1

## Customising assets and locale

* To add custom CSS for all users, edit `/var/www/iceshrimp/custom/assets/instance.css`.
* To add static assets (such as images for the splash screen), place them in the `/var/www/iceshrimp/custom/assets/` directory. They'll then be available on <https://example.com/static-assets/filename.ext>.
* To add custom locales, place them in the `/var/www/iceshrimp/custom/locales/` directory. If you name your custom locale the same as an existing locale, it will overwrite it. If you give it a unique name, it will be added to the list. Also make sure that the first part of the filename matches the locale you're basing it on. (Example: en-FOO.yml)
* To add custom error images, place them in the `/var/www/iceshrimp/custom/assets/badges` directory, replacing the files already there.
* To add custom sounds, place only mp3 files in the `/var/www/iceshrimp/custom/assets/sounds` directory.
* To update custom assets without rebuilding, just run `yarn run gulp`.
  * If a `gulp not found` error is received, run `yarn global add gulp-cli` then `yarn install` in `/var/www/iceshrimp` and try `yarn run gulp` again.
