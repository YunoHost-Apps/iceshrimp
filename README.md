## Overview

Iceshrimp is a decentralized and federated social networking service, implementing the ActivityPub standard.

It was forked from Calckey Firefish (itself a fork of Misskey) in mid-2023, to focus on stability, performance and usability instead of new features.

**Shipped version:** 2023.12.1~ynh1
